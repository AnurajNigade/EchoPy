# EchoPy
This project is a voice assistant powered by Python and OpenAI’s GPT-3 model. The voice assistant can understand and respond to a wide range of commands in natural language, providing a user-friendly interface for various tasks.
# Features
Natural Language Understanding: The voice assistant can understand commands given in natural language, making it easy and intuitive to use.
Versatile Functionality: From setting reminders to answering questions and more, the voice assistant can perform a variety of tasks.
Powered by GPT-3: Leveraging OpenAI’s powerful GPT-3 model, the voice assistant can generate human-like text based on the commands it receives.
# How It Works
The voice assistant uses speech recognition to convert spoken commands into text. This text is then processed and passed to the GPT-3 model, which generates an appropriate response. The response is then converted back into speech and read out to the user, providing a seamless voice interaction experience.

# Future Improvements
Future versions of the voice assistant will include more advanced features, such as the ability to control smart home devices, integration with various online services, and more.
